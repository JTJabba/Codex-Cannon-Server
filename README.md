## Server
The server can be downloaded [here](https://codex-cannoning.s3.amazonaws.com/codex-server-v2024.10.6.7z). The configs have been cleaned up and it's ready to use. Doesn't include any data from OG server.

### Set-up
- In terminal, make sure `java -version` says 8 (if it doesn't work try `java --version`), or modify start.bat to use a specific java 8 installation. Don't DM me to fix your java installation.
- After starting server run `op` and `whitelist add` commands in terminal.

## Archives
The public world archives from 2024-8-14 can be downloaded [here](https://codex-cannoning.s3.amazonaws.com/codex-public-worlds.7z) (3 GB).
